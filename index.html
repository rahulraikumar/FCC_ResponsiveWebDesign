    <p id="tribute-info">MTV Roadies is a youth-based popular reality television show on MTV India. The show first aired in 2003. In the show, a group of contestants travel to different destinations and participate in various tasks that seemingly challenge their physical and mental strength. During the course of the journey, there are vote outs, vote ins, eliminations and game changing twists. Eventually the contestant who manages to survive vote outs and succeed in the final task is chosen as the winner. The show has enjoyed much success among the youth. When asked about the show, the executive producer said, "Roadies has travel, adventure, drama, touch of voyeurism...".

Raghu and Rajiv, the creators of Roadies left the show in 2014. They told the media that they had done enough to popularise the show and wanted to give opportunities to the new generation to carry the show forward. The latest season titled Roadies Rising is currently underway. With a 14 year history, it is one of India's longest running shows.
